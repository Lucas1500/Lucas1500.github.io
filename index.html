			                <p> I'm a Master's Student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics: Data Science and Economics from UW. My past experiences include an internship at Tellhow where I improved the management cockpit’s evaluation of the smart city’s operating and monitoring system by 5% through formulating 7 first level indicators; as well as a collaborative experience with 8 analysts in compiling the bidding document of “<a href="https://www.tellhow.com.cn/products/show-8.html"> Management Cockpit </a> for ZGC Group” by researching 20+ software system functions, resulting in a total 100+ pages documents. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging machine learning, statistical models and programmatic data analysis. </p>

		<strong><a href = "https://github.com/Lucas1500/Parcel_population">Estimating Parcel Level Population in the Puget Sound Region</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed linear and poisson regression model (in R) to estimate parcel-level populations from the King County Assessor data and evaluated the model performance through weighted mean square error.</li>
		<li> Accounted for the survey weights of the training dataset American Community Survey (ACS) and applied cross-validation to avoid overfitting.</li>
		<li> Collaborated with epidemiologist from PHSKC (Public Health Seattle & King County) and employed this method/software to estimate the total King County population (as compared to Census estimate).</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Comparison of Machine Learning (ML) Methods for Survival Data</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed a simulation study to compare ML methods for predicting survival outcome. </li>
		<li> Wrote parallelized code (and deployed on AWS EC2) to efficiently run simulation study.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Ranking Models for Jiujitsu Competitors</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed R/C++ code for efficiently fitting penalized conditional logistic regression. </li>
		<li> Applied this to a novel dataset with ~2.5k competitors and ~8k matches to identify top competitors.</li>
		<li> Empirically explored the impact of tuning parameter selection in this problem. </li>
